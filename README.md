# Which Courses Have You Completed? 📚

I used class syntax and constructor declaration for a cleaner code structure. 
I implemented coding in both ES5 and ES6 versions, without separate file management for those who are interested in comparing the differences between these two versions on GitHub.

Languages and tools I used for this project:

- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS (Bootstrap) 🎨**
- **JavaScript 💻**

Although I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap usage (limited to some extent), it provided convenience during the project's design phase.

Looking forward to our next project together! 🚀✨
